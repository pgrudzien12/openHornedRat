# Engine architecture and modding direction

This is the implementation direction for the open engine. It is a decision record: it states the
chosen language and libraries and why, and it may be revised when a real-time prototype proves a
design wrong.

## Goals

- Run the original campaign from a legally owned installation without Wine or
  the original executable.
- Preserve the original game as a compatibility target while allowing an open,
  extensible game more like OpenXcom than a one-for-one executable replacement.
- Make rules, missions, and campaign content data-driven and modifiable.
- Keep the reverse-engineered formats and game behaviour testable without
  opening a graphical window.
- Never distribute original game assets or turn extracted assets into repository
  content.

## Chosen direction

The engine will be data-first and split into independent layers:

```text
original installation
    -> vanilla importers and asset readers
    -> normalized engine data and stable internal model
    -> deterministic headless simulation
    -> runtime frontend: rendering, sound, input, and debug UI

mod packages
    -> ordered overrides and extensions of normalized engine data
```

The original installation is the source of the vanilla campaign. Original file
formats are compatibility inputs, not the public authoring format for new
content.

### Language: Python (decided September 2026)

**Python is the main engine language.** The `whshr` package is not only the reference
implementation but the engine itself: format readers, normalized models, rules, the behaviour
bytecode interpreter, the deterministic simulation, and the runtime frontend. This supersedes the
earlier plan for a C++ SDL2/OpenGL frontend (`CMakeLists.txt`, `engine/src/main.cpp`,
`horned-rat-engine`), which is **parked**: kept in the repository for reference, not developed further.

The runtime frontend will use:

- **pygame-ce** (SDL2 underneath) for the window, input, timing, and audio output;
- **moderngl** (OpenGL 3.3 core) for rendering terrain, scenery meshes, and sprite billboards, with
  palette and colour-map lookups done at texture upload or in shaders;
- **FluidSynth** for MIDI music with the converted SoundFont, either through a binding or
  pre-rendered to PCM at load time (decided when music is added).

Both main libraries install as pre-built wheels on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Nothing is installed
without the project owner's approval.

### Why not C++

Most Python media libraries wrap the same C libraries a C++ engine would link (PyAV wraps FFmpeg,
pygame wraps SDL2, pyfluidsynth wraps FluidSynth), so C++ offers no extra decoders; Python mainly
makes them easier to install on every platform. For this game the question hardly arises: every
original format already has a verified pure-Python reader in `whshr` (Smacker, RNC ProPack, PBX,
FOL/BOP, SBK, SFX, BTS/MRC, behaviour bytecode).

Measurements on the development machine (September 2026):

| Workload | Result | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Pure-Python Smacker decoder, cutscene A13 (640×272, 1 249 frames) | whole film in 0.23 s; last frame equal to FFmpeg within ±1 per byte (palette rounding) | cutscenes need no native decoder (the films play at 8 fps) |
| FFmpeg (C), same film | 0.21 s | no practical advantage |
| Python software battle render (`viewer`, `viewer-2d`) | 0.38 s / 0.13 s per frame | per-pixel work must move to the GPU, which a C++ engine would need as well |
| Battle simulation scale | about 30 units of up to 32 models, 100 ms ticks, bytecode scripts | well within Python's reach |

A C++ engine would have to re-implement and re-verify every decoder and rule, or keep Python behind
an export step whose boundary is extra work and a source of drift; it would also need per-platform
CMake builds and development packages, and two test suites for one set of rules. Python keeps one
implementation that is already tested against the original data and is quick to change while the
rules are still being refined.

### Rules for Python performance

- Never run per-pixel loops per frame. Decode sprites, maps, and textures once at load time and
  upload them as GPU textures; sprite batches and palette lookups belong to the GPU.
- The simulation ticks at its own fixed rate (100 ms game ticks), independent of the render frame
  rate, and never depends on the frontend.
- Profile before optimising. If a hot path is proven too slow, move that one function behind a narrow
  interface (a C extension via `ctypes`/`cffi`, or Cython) without changing data definitions, the
  simulation API, or the modding contract.
- Distribution to players (a bundled application) is solved later; it does not affect the design.

### Dependencies

The readers, rules, simulation, and `scripts/` remain **Python-stdlib-only**, so they stay testable
headlessly on a bare Python installation. Only the runtime frontend depends on third-party libraries:
it lives in its own subpackage, is imported solely by the runtime command, and declares its
dependencies in a separate requirements file.

Godot remains an acceptable disposable visualization client if its tools materially accelerate an
experiment. It must not own the authoritative rule implementation, asset formats, saves, or mod
format.

## Modding contract

Modding must be designed into the data layer rather than added after the
renderer is complete. Initial mods should be declarative packages containing
human-editable metadata and assets, with:

- stable, namespaced identifiers;
- documented schemas and validation;
- explicit package dependencies and deterministic load order;
- defined override and merge rules;
- versioned formats and compatibility policy; and
- no requirement to create original `.BTS`, `.MRC`, `.FOL`, `.BOP`, or mission
  bytecode files.

The precise text format (YAML or JSON) is deferred until the normalized models
exist. It must be easy to diff, review, generate, and validate. The engine's
own save format will be separate from both original save files and mod source
data.

Do not initially permit arbitrary native plug-ins or unrestricted code from a
mod package. They undermine reproducibility, compatibility, and user safety.
When declarative content cannot express a mission mechanic, introduce a small,
sandboxed, documented, and versioned mission scripting API. That API is a
future public contract, not a wrapper around internal engine objects.

## Vanilla mission compatibility

Do not load or execute the original `SCRIPT/BFxxx.DLL` files as native DLLs.
They are containers for bytecode tables interpreted by `GAMEF.DLL`; executing
their original native environment would retain the proprietary engine's
platform, safety, and compatibility problems.

Instead:

1. Read the mission bytecode tables from the original DLLs as data.
2. Implement the required original bytecode interpreter and its narrow engine
   API in the open engine.
3. Use this interpreter to run and validate unmodified vanilla missions.
4. Decode and translate established bytecode behaviour into a readable,
   normalized mission representation.
5. Author new missions through the future mod-facing mission format, while
   retaining original bytecode support for vanilla compatibility.

This avoids prematurely reinventing unknown mission semantics while preventing
the opaque original bytecode from becoming the permanent modding language.

## Constraints and non-goals

- The simulation must remain deterministic and runnable headlessly so rules,
  missions, and imported content can be regression-tested.
- Rendering must consume simulation state, not define it; no gameplay rule
  should depend on a scene graph, editor resource, frame rate, or renderer.
- Original assets remain local to a user's installation or a local cache and
  must never be committed or redistributed.
- Claims about matching original behaviour require static evidence and, where
  practical, visual, audible, or Wine-based runtime verification.
- Exact original camera parameters are not a goal; the established perspective
  scene is sufficient for an engine.
- A custom frontend has a higher initial rendering/UI cost than an engine integration. It is
  justified while its independent data model and single-language workflow serve the project better.

## Near-term consequences

1. Keep the simulation API independent of pygame-ce, moderngl, and any other presentation library.
2. After approval to install pygame-ce and moderngl, add the frontend subpackage and its requirements
   file.
3. Engine phase 1, in order: a battle view (plan map or terrain, directional sprites in the traced
   formations) → movement on 100 ms ticks → scenes (menu, transitions, mission briefing, cutscene
   playback with the pure-Python Smacker decoder into a texture) → simplified close combat, shooting,
   and morale from `notes/game_rules.md` → one winnable battle.
4. The behaviour bytecode opcodes are catalogued (`python3 -m whshr scripts`); implement the
   interpreter in the simulation after the first battle runs with a simple rule-based AI.

## Current prototype

`whshr.engine` defines the presentation-independent battle state and fixed-tick movement behaviour,
and the Python `SceneMachine` provides the scene lifecycle. `scripts/run_engine.sh` starts it, plays
the `A1.SI` intro through `ffplay` at the verified 8 fps, and enters the menu scene; the `ffplay`
playback is a stopgap until the frontend plays films itself.

The C++ SDL2/OpenGL movement prototype (`CMakeLists.txt`, `engine/src/main.cpp`) is parked. Original
mission DLLs are data inputs only: the engine will never execute them as native code.
